This is the source code for a wee little Twitter Bot that sends out greetings far and wide to each country that the International Space Station visits. (And by visits, I mean flies directly overtop. The geocoding is quite precise)

The bot can be found at [https://twitter.com/IssGreetings](https://twitter.com/IssGreetings)
